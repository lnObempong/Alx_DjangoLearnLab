User Authentication System Documentation
Overview

The authentication system in the Django Blog project enables users to:

Register a new account

Log in to their account

Log out securely

View their profile information

This system is built using Django’s built-in authentication framework, extended with a custom registration form and profile view.

Features

User Registration

New users can sign up with a username, email, and password.

Passwords are hashed securely by Django before being stored in the database.

Upon successful registration, users are automatically logged in and redirected to their profile page.

User Login

Existing users can log in using their username and password.

Invalid login attempts display error messages for user guidance.

User Logout

Logged-in users can log out securely.

After logout, users are redirected to a confirmation page with the option to log back in.

User Profile

Authenticated users can view their profile details (username and email).

The profile page is protected and requires the user to be logged in.

Routes (URLs)
Path	View	Description

Templates

register.html → Registration form

login.html → Login form

logout.html → Logout confirmation page

profile.html → Profile details page

All templates extend from the base layout (base.html) and use Django’s form rendering system.

Security

CSRF Protection: All forms include {% csrf_token %} to prevent CSRF attacks.

Password Hashing: Passwords are securely hashed using Django’s built-in authentication system.

Access Control: The profile page is restricted to logged-in users only via the @login_required decorator.
