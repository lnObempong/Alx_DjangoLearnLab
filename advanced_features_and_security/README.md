# Permissions and Groups Setup

This project demonstrates managing permissions and groups in Django.

## Custom Permissions
The `Book` model defines the following permissions:
- `can_view` – Can view book records
- `can_create` – Can create book records
- `can_edit` – Can edit book records
- `can_delete` – Can delete book records

## Groups
- **Viewers** → can_view
- **Editors** → can_view, can_create, can_edit
- **Admins** → all permissions

## Views Protection
Views are protected using `@permission_required`:
- `book_list` → requires `can_view`
- `book_create` → requires `can_create`
- `book_edit` → requires `can_edit`
- `book_delete` → requires `can_delete`

## Testing
1. Create users via Django Admin
2. Assign them to groups
3. Try accessing book pages to verify permissions enforcement
